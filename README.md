# Core War in JavaScript

This is an experimental implementation of a Core War engine based on
[ICWS 94](http://www.koth.org/info/icws94.html) version 3.2. This project is
in its early stage of development.

## Using

You need GNU Make and Less CSS compiler. Run

```
make
```

in the project root. Then point your browser to the `corewar.html` file. Some
example warriors can be found in the `warriors` directory. Have fun!
